# Colours

Our TailwindCSS theme defines a palette of University of Guelph brand colours which are WCAG Level AA compliant.

Each colour defines a set of swatches which are to be used in various situations:

- base: Official University of Guelph brand colour.
- bg: Background colour.
- contrast: Preferred colour to use against the background colour.
- focus: Hover and focus styles.
- on-light: for text, graphical objects, and/or user interface components when placed on top of our light-grey-bg.
- on-dark: for text, graphical objects, and/or user interface components when placed on top of our dark-grey-bg.

Below, you will see each colour and their available swatches (each swatch will display its name, the CSS variable it's associated with and the hex code).
