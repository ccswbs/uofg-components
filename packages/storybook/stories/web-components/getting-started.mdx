# Introduction

This is a library of web components designed for use across various University of Guelph websites.

## Usage

The recommended method for including the web components in your page is to use a CDN like unpkg or jsdelivr.

The package contains a stylesheet that is required for the components to render correctly.
As such, you must link to the stylesheet in the `<head>` of your HTML:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@uoguelph/web-components/web-components/dist/uofg-web-components/uofg-web-components.css"
/>
```

Note the above will always load the latest version of the library.
This is not recommended for production use, as new releases may introduce breaking changes.
Instead, use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to specify a version range.
For example, to always load the latest version of the 2.x.x series, add the following to the `<head>` of your HTML:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@uoguelph/web-components@2.x.x/dist/uofg-web-components/uofg-web-components.css"
/>
```

To load the components, add the following to the `<head>` of your HTML as well:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@uoguelph/web-components@2.x.x/dist/uofg-web-components/uofg-web-components.esm.js"
></script>
```

This will load all the web components in the library.

You can also load each component individually, and thus can load only the components you are planning on using.

For more details about this, view the documentation for the individual components.
At the top of each component's documentation, you will find the code to load that component.
