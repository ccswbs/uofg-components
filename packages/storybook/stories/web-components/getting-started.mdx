# Introduction

This is a library of web components designed for use across various University of Guelph websites. These components are built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), a compiler/framework that simplifies the development of component libraries.

## Adding Components to a Page

The recommended method for including the web components in your page is to use [unpkg](https://www.unpkg.com), a fast, globally available CDN for npm packages.

To always load the latest version, add the following to the `<head>` of your HTML:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/@uoguelph/web-components/dist/uofg-web-components/uofg-web-components.css"
/>
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://unpkg.com/@uoguelph/web-components/dist/uofg-web-components/uofg-web-components.esm.js"
></script>
```

### Including a single component

Using `uofg-web-components.esm.js` will load all the web-components in the library, which may not be what you desire.

You can load each component individually, and thus can load only the components you are planning on using, by replacing the `uofg-web-components.esm.js` in the `src` attribute in the `script` with the name of the component you want. For example, if I only want to load the header:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://unpkg.com/@uoguelph/web-components/dist/uofg-web-components/uofg-header.esm.js"
></script>
```

### Best Practice: Specify a Version Range

While loading the latest version ensures you're using the most current features, it’s not always best practice. New releases may introduce breaking changes that could impact your page’s functionality. Instead, it’s safer to specify a version range following semantic versioning (semver).

Semantic versioning follows the format `x1.x2.x3`:

- **Major (x1)**: Potentially breaking changes.
- **Minor (x2)**: New features, backward compatible.
- **Patch (x3)**: Bug fixes, backward compatible.

For example, specifying `1.x.x` will ensure you get the latest release of version 1 (without breaking changes). Here's how you can do it:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/@uoguelph/web-components@1.x.x/dist/uofg-web-components/uofg-web-components.css"
/>
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://unpkg.com/@uoguelph/web-components@1.x.x/dist/uofg-web-components/uofg-web-components.esm.js"
></script>
```

Using a version range like this will prevent unexpected issues and ensure stability until you’re ready to upgrade to a new major release.
