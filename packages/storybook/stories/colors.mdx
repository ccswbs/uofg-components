# Colors

The University of Guelph brand guide defines a palette of colors which are to be used on any University of Guelph web
page.

Each color has three variants:
- base: the base color.
- light: a lightened version of the base color.
- dark: a darkened versio of the base color.

Each variant defines a set of swatches which are to be used in various situations:

- base: the base version of the color.
- bg: a less saturated version of the base color that works well as a background for text.
- contrast: a color which reaches at minimum AA contrast when displayed on the base color.
- focus: for hover and focus styles.
- on-light: for using the color as text over a neutral light background (Grey light bg), while meeting AA contrast.
- on-dark: for using the color as text over a neutral dark background (Grey dark bg), while meeting AA contrast.

Below you will see each color and their swatches.
