# University of Guelph Components

To make the development of brand compliant web pages easier,
we have created a collection of npm packages that offer components, styles, etc.
Below is a list of the packages and their purposes.

For more information about a specific package, please refer to the documentation for that package.

## Packages

- **@uoguelph/react-components**: A collection of components for use in React projects.
- **@uoguelph/web-components**: A collection of framework-agnostic web components.
- **@uoguelph/tailwind-theme**: A theme which can be used in any project using TailwindCSS.

## Fonts

Whenever you use any of the aforementioned packages, you must include the fonts **DM Sans** and **Bitter**.
as they are not typically available by default in most browsers or systems.
The easiest way to do this is via Google Fonts:

Using HTML:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin="anonymous" />
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Sans:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
```

Using CSS:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bitter:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap');
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Sans:ital,opsz,wght@0,9..40,100..1000;1,9..40,100..1000&display=swap');
```

You can use any approach you prefer,
such as hosting the fonts yourself, but our recommendation is you use one of the above methods.

## Root Font Size and REM units

The root font size of University of Guelph web pages is 10px.

This means that 1rem = 10px, 2rem = 20px, etc.

This is done by setting the font size of the html element to 62.5%:

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
```

This is done as both a developer convenience (rem units are easier to work with when 1rem = 10px)
and an accessibility feature (pages will scale according to the user's preferred font size).

If you are correctly using any of the packages in this monorepo, this will be done for you.
but its important to note that any custom CSS you write that uses rem units should be done with this in mind,
otherwise the sizing of the elements you are styling will be incorrect.
