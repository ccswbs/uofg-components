# Introduction

This is a library of React components designed for use in any University of Guelph React project.

## Install the package

Install the package using the package manager of your choice.

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @uoguelph/react-components

# Using Yarn
yarn add @uoguelph/react-components

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @uoguelph/react-components

# Using bun
bun add @uoguelph/react-components
```

Then, import the components you want to use in your project.
You can see the individual component documentation for more information on how to use and import each component.

## Styles

### Without using Tailwind CSS

The components in this library are designed to be used with Tailwind CSS.
If you are not using Tailwind CSS in your project,
or you want to keep the styles of the components separate from your own,
you will need to include the stylesheet provided in the package.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/node_modules/@uoguelph/react-components/dist/index.css" />
```

Or if you are using a bundler like Webpack, you can import the stylesheet in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
import '@uoguelph/react-components/dist/index.css';
```

### Using Tailwind CSS

If you are using Tailwind CSS in your project, you can use the components without including the stylesheet.
Doing this will save some bandwidth as the components will share the same styles as your own.
However, this will require you
to include our [Tailwind CSS theme package](/?path=/docs/tailwind-theme-getting-started--docs) in your project,
as well as using [Tailwind's prefix option](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/styling-with-utility-classes#using-the-prefix-option) to prefix all Tailwind classes with `uog`.

You will also need the [@headlessui/tailwindcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@headlessui/tailwindcss) plugin.

Then, make sure your Tailwind CSS config file looks like this:

```css
@import '@uoguelph/tailwind-theme' prefix(uog);
@source 'PATH_TO_YOUR_NODE_MODULES_FOLDER/node_modules/@uoguelph/react-components';
@plugin "@headlessui/tailwindcss";
```
